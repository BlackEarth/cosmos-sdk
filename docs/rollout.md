Cosmos Hub (Gaia) Rollout Plan
------------------------------

Stage 1 (AiB): Staking, slashing, governance, transfers written but disabled with a switch.

Expect instability. In this stage, chain could be rolled-back to genesis.

Stage 2 (governance): Transfers enabled.

Governance should enable once they believe the chain stable. State will not be rolled back (presumably).

Stage 3 (governance): IBC finished and enabled.
